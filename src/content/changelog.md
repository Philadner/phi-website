ever wanted to see raw development pain?  
well now you can [here](labs.phi.me.uk/realchangelog)

## sync labs with main
the main website has been looking hella boring because i've just been working on labs  
so now i've synced both the websites up so you don't have to type an extra labs in the url bar  
if you have any complaints (probably with the music player being a bit iffy) shoot me an email [here](mailto:phil@phi.me.uk)  
Link to [main](phi.me.uk) and [labs](labs.phi.me.uk) websites

## The new ticker on the homepage
Yeah so iwas bored so i added a ticker on the top of the home page.  
It pulls from the exact same list as the looping list of random words that's front and centre  
Just looks cool  
Also i made it a lot easier for me to make these changelogs. instead of writing code i can just  
write normal text.

## The new Titlebar
It's the titlebar's turn to get a massive facelift  
It gets big it gets small it is lovely to all  
For my computer people you can hover on it while it's small to enlarge

---

## aura music player
The music player now has many fancy effects.  
Stuff blurs, stuff slides in, and stuff also kinda jumps around glitchily sometimes :(

---

## FIXED EVERYTHING
Yeah I hadn't been looking at the actual main website much  
Almost everything that you can't see was broken  
So check it all out [here](https://phi.me.uk/workinhardorhardlyworkin)

## Workin hard or hardly workin?
A sidebar has been added because the top menu was getting hella cramped on mobile  
Good news! there is a new flashy thing in the sidebar (I had much fun making it)  
When you click it you're taken to a page where you can see how feverishly I'm updating the labs.phi.me.uk site  
By the way I made the YouTube redirect quicker — I was bored.

## The New hamburger menu
The top navbar was getting a bit cluttered so I made a new hamburger menu  
This website is now 10% epicer  
Ok bye pookies

---

## The revamped music player!
The music player has gotten a massive facelift.  
Made it look better with separate pages for each item  
It also shows a lot more results at once and is a lot less glitchy

---

## Some nerdy dev stuff that's kinda relevant to you
I've merged the labs and main branch so now labs.phi.me.uk and phi.me.uk are the same rn  
So much more new things happen on labs btw  
So check that changelog if you want to see new exciting things when I'm bothered to code.
