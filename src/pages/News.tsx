          Oscar is really cool because he brings great energy, stays kind to
          everyone, and always has something positive to share. Whether it’s
          helping out, cracking a joke, or just being around, Oscar makes the
          vibe better.

          It’s the little things that add up: reliable support, a calm attitude
